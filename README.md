# <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10755>Interpretable and Robust AI in EEG Systems: A Survey</a>




This is a repository maintain an ever-evolving list of papers on the interpretability and robustness of AI in EEG systems, with frequent updates to ensure its comprehensiveness
and timeliness.


## The contribution of this survey
1. This is the first comprehensive survey focusingon the interpretability and robustness of AI in EEG systems.
2. We propose a novel taxonomy of interpretability and robustness for EEG systems.
3. We summarize and highlight the emerging and most representative interpretable and robust AI works related to EEG systems.
4. We discuss some open problems and promising directions for future EEG systems.
